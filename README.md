# Popup News Web Component 📰

This is a simple and clean popup component built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The page contains a **"Get News"** button.
- When the user clicks **Get News**, a popup appears on the screen.
- This is done by **adding an `open` class** to the popup container.
- Inside the popup, there's a **cancel (❌) button**.
- Clicking the cancel button **removes the `open` class**, closing the popup.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – The main structure of the page.
- `style.css` – Styling for the button and popup.
- `script.js` – Logic for opening and closing the popup.
